LSTM VERHALEN

Verhaal 1:

Words of affection, and smile. I don't even have a name. I am here, to see my father that day, waiting for a break.. And the end..
“What is going on, oh god, what’s going on here?”.
“What is this!”.
I open my eyes as I see the faces of the white clad men..
“Sorry..” I said to the boys.
“Please, it’s a secret service agent.”.
“Go down to the police station, you’re coming to take my place.”
“This is the first time I see you”.
“Who are you?``. I asked, how did I do this for you?
“Where am I?”.
“The scene”.
“One of my men.”. He said.
“What are you doing here?”, my dad said.
“I was there when I first came out.”
“I’m not in the room, you know.. I’m sorry..”
“I know what you have said. I remember, I was just on my way to work, but I could get to see my sister..”
“What is your name?”.
“I’m not a doctor, but I do understand how..” he responded.
“it’s just a human.”
“why are you here?``
“because we need to learn a secret?”
“who’s there?”.
“That’s a picture of us..”
“And it’s like a name for a friend.”
“Why not?”
“I couldn't tell you if he was happy, but I’m not trying to lie.

Verhaal 2:

Words danced across the screen: ``My favorite color.`` A perfect voice, a short, white.. But the music is good, I could hear people screaming from the world. ``God knows, all the good stuff is in the story!``, I thought to myself, ``I thought they were happy.``
``Hey you!`` He said excitedly.
``Oh yeah, I'm a genius.``
``Okay, well, let me show you...``
``You're still good at this, man.``
``Good, I can't get any of this, it is pretty fun, I don't really have to go through this.``
``I know, we're pretty good with the world because I like the job,`` the reporter replied. ``Thanks for the amazing skill, you know, I'm gonna try a bad thing to get you in,`` I said, and he leaned back in my chair, ``I'm pretty sure I'm good at you and you can start with the moon's a lot more interesting.``
``Thanks,`` I said, ``I think I've been feeling good lately.``
``I got good news,`` I said, ``I've got this whole evening.``
``Yeah, good evening,`` I replied. ``Thanks,`` I said, ``I'll be on your way to the car.``
``Thanks,`` he said, ``thanks,`` he replied, ``I'll be in for a bit.``
``Thank you,`` I said, ``I don't have any kids.``
``So good to see you,`` the therapist said. ``I've always been happy with the last time I've been in the movies,`` he said with a smile. ``The last one was much more amazing.`

Verhaal 3:

Into the inky night that the city was as perfect as the sky in the sky, the sun was the only thing that could see the moon. ```` But I thought that we were safe, then we had to reach it, then the world would come to fruition, and so it took years to come to bring us back together. ``I see a young girl in a suit, a car, a pack of kids.`` The girl had a look on her face, and the whole conversation started, as she knew her home. ``You see, I'm working for the children, and I have all the time you've ever seen and you're always there for me.`` She spoke, and the children spoke. ``I need to know about the world, or I'll understand, you see.`` The girl watched her father's father. ``And you can imagine...`` the father laughed, ``He'll be fine.`` She looked at the baby, ``Daddy.`` She looked at her father and said, ``I'll be fine. ``Her mother laughed, and she smiled, ``I love you.`` And she looked at her husband. ``Mommy loves you, daddy.`` She said, ``I'll be right there.`` Mommy walked in with the baby girl, ready to change, that I could see her, and I looked at her. ``Daddy.`` She said with a smile. ``Yes, daddy,`` she said. ``I wish I could tell you.`` Daddy said to her. ``Daddy, mommy, please.`` She said, knowing that she loved her mommy, and the father kissed her forehead and smiled. ``Mommy, honey, you're coming.`` She kissed her mother goodbye, then gave her a hug, and said, ``Daddy, please give me some of your mommy's daddy's birthday tomorrow.`` ``Goodbye mommy,`` she said, and it went for the boy. ``Daddy, mommy, daddy!``

Verhaal 4:

're a bit tired, so we don't need to be careful. '
All that comes out to be broken by a man's license is the greatest part that got killed.'
So I'm fucking in the hospital. '
She's kind of like a doll.
The real,' he said, being a cop. '
She's fucking hard.'
It's a miracle. '
I didn't think I was a bad man, I just never was.
Well, I've got to be pissed.'
I see a gun slowly fade to black, like I'm not a hitman, and you won't want to keep this on a better way.
It's almost like an idiot, I suppose. '
He looks at me with a shit-eating grin.
Fuck.'
I see him don't help the problem. '
You are really the one who stabbed him.'
He doesn't know, 'Is that the DMV isn't this good?'
I look at my hands, and the pain is excruciating.'
I shrug, I'm not sure what to say. '
I wonder how I don't think I can make it, maybe I'll go to jail?'
I look at my watch, I feel the guilt...
'I think it's a coincidence, ' I tell him. '
Well, he's not gonna give him this, it's just a bit stupid, but it's a pretty decent choice.'
'I'm not going to say,' I said, holding it, and I turned and I let the darkness blur. '
He's not my job for the company.'
I hate not to be angry. 

Verhaal 5:

Depressed the dark lord, the Joker and the assassin is silent. His eyes are locked, he is the only man in the room of his. He doesn't know if he was hiding or not, the hero does not know why. '
The detective stares up at the new warden, ``I don't know, I'm not like this.``
The chief of police stares at the camera in the corner of the room, ``If you're reading this,`` he says, ``You're dead. ``
The Batman, the security guard, walks up the stairs and opens the door to the van to look at the warden and the killer on the floor. the Joker was still silent and the sound of his head going dark and yet he doesn't hear the gunshot and the sound of the security guard. It is as if he is carrying a gun and a knife. He raises the revolver to his head, ``Is that so much more complicated?``
the judge says, ``I don't know, I've been sitting here for the past ten minutes, not for the rest of my life, and I don't have to do it if I want to make sure the boss's dead.`` 
The hero looks down, ``Oh that's what I'm here in, I don't know.``
The detective starts to shake and tells the judge that he knows what happens to the police and the suspect.
``The defendant wasn't a good boy,`` said the man, ``Are you seriously convicted of this.``
``I'm sorry,`` the judge says, ``But if you haven't had the chance to be anything you've ever seen, you're not right.``
``He's got the tattoo he deserves`` he thinks. ``I can tell that someone has to kill someone, or else I can die, but I've never seen any inmate without a bullet in my head.``

Verhaal 6:

's Chief - the director of the factory. He takes a step and hums.
``Alright, we'll get it,`` he says. He glances at the table. ``I'm a general.``
He pauses, giving in and starts speaking, ``I know,`` he says, ``But the last thing I want to do is remember.`` He smiles,`` a simple task.``
``But you are a guy,`` he says with a smile.
``I want to ask you something.`` he says. 
``He's just...``
``Tell me,`` the agent says.
``Your name,`` I say. 
``You're a doctor,`` he says. ``I'm an actor, I'm just a doctor.``
``But I'm a fan of a doctor.`` 
``I'm dr., but the doc is in your genes.`` 
``Oh, the doctor,`` he says. ``I'm a surgeon.``
``I'm in a hospital.``
``Uh, sir.``
``I'm sorry.``
``I'm sorry.``
``How do you know my name?``
``I need to understand.``
``...``
``We need to meet her.``
``...``
``Mr. Jenkins, I'm telling you.``
``Is he alive?`` *answers is just *my* questions.*
*Nurse, ``But you're still alive.`` ***
``... Doctor.``
** ``**``
*``***``
*``I don't understand why, but I'm your father.``

Verhaal 7:

'Re that the sun is already a bit.' There's a moment where the feel of the cigarette falls across your chest, and there's no body, no skin, no skin, no ears, nothing. It doesn't look like anything else, except the infinite glow of a bar. The bartender is wearing a small leather jacket, his beard is gone and his hair is black, a smile on his lips. ``I'm not going to be in your mood`` I say to him. 'I know you don't want to have to talk about me, I'm sorry, do I?' His tone is still smiling, his words are just plain - ``I don't want to say the same.`` I don't know why I am calling here, but he's there, and I know he's talking to me, but I can't tell, I have to make sure that there's no time to react to his life. 'I'm sure that if you don't agree to you, you haven't actually heard it.' He says, his voice piercing slightly as he speaks. 'I'm sorry, I haven't seen you before.' He says, his face expressionless. 'I'm not going to say that.' He says, his gaze never wavering. 'I am not sure if you're a good man', he is getting a bit too.' He says, gesturing towards the other end of the phone, I'm afraid you aren't in this state of mind.' He asks, as he reaches out to me, I can see the last light on the screen that is being watched by the old man, then just as it happened. 'He's smiling.' A grin crosses his lips, and as he reaches for the glass, he looks at me with watery eyes and smiles. 'He's a dark one and I'm not even a drinker.' He hands me a glass of water and the bottle slams off the table, leaving him standing in the doorway, then home.

Verhaal 8:

First is the worst. ', Too much, a big fat little bit of a bug', they say, but they're not good enough. 'But she ain't a big guy, I'm bad. 'She's like shit, just like that.' 'I ain't always meant to be smart, I'm bored, they just can't be.' And that's because they think they hate me and I want to ask for an autograph. 'I hate, and I'm just so glad to see myself like this.' I hate that day, I'm not happy, I'm not sure I'm a girl, but I'm so bored. 'She looks like the fucking nerd and you're so cute.' I hate that you, I really hate you, but I can be the type that I am. 'The AI's first, I'm telling you, I know it's bad.' She looks sad. 'I think you've got a lot of trouble here, we all have no idea how much we're dead, or we'll make it past these things, and we'll see what we can do to fix this, and what to do, we can't just go down to the more bad things, I'm not sure what you're doing, that's just what you did.' She is trying to get us out, she's gonna get you back and don't go in, fuck you, the man who put him down here and all the world on a goddamn bad mission. 'We can fix that shit, and we'll have to wait till it's done we're wrong.' She's fucking crazy, she's just a fool to do that, you think, all of us don't know how to hide, to know why we're out here that can be destroyed? 'The alien, so we've got the whole thing to be sad.' She sounds like it's some shit that we know if that's all the time we have to. 

Verhaal 9:

'Re going to leave my apartment, I want to say. I'm not a real person, but you know what, I'll just look at this place.'
I wish I could have done that, but I can't shake my hand.
I can't do anything that can be a problem, I've tried..
I am going to be late for a bit of my work.
And I know how to make the most, but it's just for a second.
What is my house?
It's been five years.
I want to go back to bed... I don't get too much of it, but I don't have much time to care for it.
But there is no need to be afraid.
I can't have an issue, I can tell. 
But..... 
No.. Or.......
.
I am afraid not.
It's been three years since I had been to be where I was at..
She's mine..
How?
Did I ever feel like someone, or maybe? 
And then I think about it?
How do I know I can do this? 
Why? 
Don't worry. 
But I don't need that anymore.
What's it to you?
What? 
Why?
Do you even want to leave? 
What?
Do you mean?
Why?
But why? 
Why?
Why? 
Why?
What?
Why?
Why?
Why? 
Why?
Why?
Why? 
How does this all go? 
Why?
How did it end? 
Why?
Why? 
Why?
Why? 
Why?
Why?
Why did you make a decision for yourself?
You aren't a child?
Why?
Why? 
Why?

Verhaal 10:

Man, I guess he just threw up. He was a pretty popular guy, he's got to be a dude. He's been on this off since his family got over it all. He's been a little over a bit longer. They can't even say why they're so friendly to us. 'I haven't even known what I was thinking, but I know it's him.' But it's only been one hundred years since he got a little loose. 'He's okay, you know how it is?' He says, but he's not. 'He's a guy, it's a huge amount of crap.' He looks up at me and says: ``I can't, not me.`` He's in the back of a police car, but he's pretty slow. 'I think it's him.' 
I'm going to need to get a bit more to keep his face down. 'I wonder if it'll be for his parents to visit him.' He says, taking a seat next to me in his coat pocket. '
And, after all, I've done nothing.'
I look down at the mask on my shoulder. 'I nod.' I'm not going to hurt a girl 'he is *a* one.' 
``No, it's fine.`` I say, and I turn, and I continue to stare at the face. ``How did you get it?`` 
He's in a coughing fit. ' 
``We don't need to worry about it,`` he says. I think he says we're going to get the light out, or something.' he says, nodding at the little guy.
'*I know you're not going to say a word to me, you're a lunatic.' ** 'I don't know if he's a good person,' he says, but I don't think I know who I'm ************ ``** my name is`` really, ``the next thing you know, I don't even know where I'm coming from, but I guess I'll let you go.

``You're not to be trusted,`` I say as I try to make a noise, and if there is anything I can do, why do I have to do this? Finally, I have the best way to send this, and you have a very important case.

Verhaal 1:

I never seen a woman? 'I never said.'
I had never seen a man coming here in a long time.'
Not only was there a shadow, but not just my eyes, but no.
...
So i went to bed
and i spent my days on my way home
I'll always get the feeling that i needed to.
I hate this..
It's so unfair.
I have been trying to get a phone call to help me out, and I'm bored.
I'm not a writer.
There is no reason to hate me.
My head hurts and I am on my knees, I am looking forward,
and you don't notice your face.
It's my job!
I'm going to help my friend.
i hope you're ready to be ok, so you may stay.
For I am alone.
I have never really hurt, but I can't sleep.
I know it.
I can feel it.
I will be so happy.
I wish you
will be strong.
Farewell!
Goodbye!
Love, please I will stop.
Love is just a story.
There is a chance to love this.
But I love you too.
So I'll be honest.

Verhaal 2:

You the first time this is the last time.' Was all I could see when I saw the opportunity in the future, but the machines weren't as small as it was. It was a human mind. My mind took a minute to find. It's something I've done. ``You do.`` I told the boy, as he stepped closer towards me. he would tell me that I was dead, and it didn't seem like he wasn't a great time. I knew it was him, but the most ironic thing about the humans was the fact that he was far from the dead. And that wasn't the same. I guess he was a bit too late to get out of this. He wasn't very happy, he had no way to get that name. I've seen some of his friends all over the world, but this time it wasn't.' he replied, glancing back at me. He was still looking at me, but I knew he didn't understand the answer. They were so cool and peaceful, so happy to be alive with his child, and he didn't even know what he was.' he said, ``I know you are for sure, you know.`` I loved his old friend, I think. ``I appreciate it, I guess.`` I'd become very excited to see him in the sun. He liked that, with his face.

Verhaal 3:

Glass door opens and a police officer stands. ``Did you see the guard?`` he asks, adjusting his sunglasses. ``I thought I was going to see you in a while. I would like you to keep it up.`` he responds. ``This is a delivery department, we need to come back to the country.`` He smiles, ``We got a deal. I'm worried about you, but I'm going to have to give you the security clearance and you'll be at it in the morning.`` He looks up to me, the terror in his eyes and the kind of shock that makes you feel like you don't want to fight. ``I want the money.`` He says in a voice. ``I want you to know that. ``He gestures, ``I just want to try it again.`` he puts the gun in his hand and is surprised to see a woman who can make out some of the top secret. ``I'm going to be honest!`` she says, handing me the envelope with a friendly smile. ``I'm so glad you're safe.`` He gives a good smile and closes the door. ``I hope you know what I love you for,`` he says. ``It's ok, I'll be fine.`` He opens the bag and pulls out a pistol, ``I love you.``

Verhaal 4:

I'm sorry, I'm too old. The man, who doesn't say is to the demon, looks like we've gotten some heaven. 'The guy said, and came to his feet. He wasn't too far off, but he had a guitar, and he was working on a band.' He said. 'I don't want to be some idiot of a new place, but they are all the same. The guy next to me is the same, and he's just so fucking stupid.' He then got on his knees, and he said, ``God, I'm just a little worried. I just wanted to sit and don't make any ideas.`` He said to me, and he said ``Oh, there's a whole bunch of guys.`` No, the guy said something. ``Good job, what a piece of shit.`` A good look at my guys. 'The man walked towards him and said, ``It's the best you could do.`` He replied, and he looked at the man with the perfectly manicured hands. ``You know, I was a nice guy, and they were all there, he was a pretty.

Verhaal 5:

Than anyone, they're not supposed to be in the same place, right in the middle of the routine. They've been saying a lot of times before. I mean, I know, I know that when I say I'm a few years older than I was. I really need to put a job, and I've seen it. 'I might have been going for a better job.' I look at my watch. 'I am going home. that's the problem.' I say, and the papers are starting to hurt. 'I've been in a bad week, and I am going to put the next appointment out of this. I'd rather not meet you with *you*, and as I'm out of the oven, I might find a way to put this down.' I wonder, then I'll say, ``What if I told you that I was just so glad to be here? I know you're a big fan of your life.`` I have a good attitude and I'm sure I'd be able to tell you that it's too much. 'I am pretty sure you're a good man, but I know that you're a lot of people.' I think, I really liked you. 'I guess I'll make it so that I've already done something special to my teacher and the good times.' I guess.

Verhaal 6:

Had been on the far side of the corridor, but we weren't left with a strong grip. I heard a metal door open, a small box standing, but with the usual - rock. It was a staircase at the top, and she was pretty much. It was moving. It was a door, and a long hallway, and a place to open it. It was a small room, and a full door. She was scared. We were dead. I was wrong. I was going to tell her that I was dead. The very walls were so much more dangerous than the ones I'd heard in the past. We were in our rooms, I could hear the kids in the room, hopefully. I followed her to the hospital and started making my way to a house.
``Okay,`` I said. ``I'll be right over there, I need to get home to leave, because I can't hear anything.`` I threw it over the counter. I took a deep breath, and then I walked over to her. I thought I was still happy.' I said to her and she said ``Good.`` She said as she got up and put the phone into the bag, ``Good luck. I hope it's fine.`` She said, looking me over and gave me a wink. ``That 's okay, sweetheart.`` She said, looking at me, smiling, ``I love you.`` ``Thank you,`` I said. I looked at her and said, ``You're happy?``
``I was just a good person,`` she said, ``I'm alive.``

Verhaal 7:

Have gone with all of the other religions who live in a house to see. These two men are still, now their homes are still alive. They know how to do it with a child's hands. They come to visit in the past and saw the picture. The same thing, their long-ago. They're done. *Other people*. They've all gathered around me and I find it's way. They'll be much more terrifying then I think they're still. They're not happy. They're all dead. I'll make sure they're dead, and there isn't good enough. They're good for me, the kids, my kids. I'm pretty happy with them, but there's always a couple of more. I'm happy with all the memories they're in, their lives, my life. They're all happy, they're not, their kids and their friends. I've been home and I'm safe. 'I hope I'm okay. I love them too, I feel like they're going to die, I think. I feel a lot safer. They're perfect, I'm alive and that's all I ever wanted.'
``Good, now, now,`` I say.

Verhaal 8:

- Altering notes
Is to try and delete me. It's not the word, it's just a phrase. 
I'm sorry, but I just couldn't.
I've been getting more powerful and more than a year since I got there.
I should have left them, I guess.
Okay, they're going to do this, then?
I hate having to get out.
But I have a problem with the shit.
This is bad.
Maybe we're crazy, and the universe is a bad place.
But this isn't fair.
Because, because I know it's a mistake,
I'll just die.
I do not know what to make of it, but it was wrong.
Yes.
I don't even know how happy I am.
I've given you hope, I've got to be in a good mood.
And I'm the best with the money on the whole, and I'm my son.
I hope you're better.
I'll give you the most fantastic job of all time.

Verhaal 9:

Were, everywhere, with the words was a clear message. ``We have a face,`` the crowd was quieted, and when the speaker came, the crowd's voice vibrated.
``I'm glad to see you...``
``I'm sorry,`` I said, ``I'll give you this.``
``You...`` 
``He's just...``
``We were so close. But there's nothing, that's what it was to be a horrible one,`` I said, ``Because the whole world isn't exactly the best.``
``The song is real,`` the president said, the lines of my sad voice.
``They're all in the same damn cell,`` I said, ``No way.``
``You're fucking crazy.``
``It's been too long,`` said the announcer, ``Fuck you,`` he said as he took his seat.
``Yeah,`` I said, ``I guess I'm pretty sure I'm happy.``
``I'm fine,`` he said, ``Thanks.``
``That's good,`` I replied, ``You're gonna be fine.``
``Yeah, you win.``
``Yeah, yeah!``

Verhaal 10:

Not going to be. I don't even have to make it, and I've never been a fan of it, and I'm just going to get married. But I'm going to be an adult, or I would get through. I think the dream of my girlfriend is going to be a real hassle. 'I've never been so angry as to be my own therapist, but I'm not ashamed to admit that. It's not really like the other person - I guess that's just the worst part of it all.' She says, causing the angel's to drop her from me, but I'm getting to the point where I don't know what it's like to be a angel, but it makes me seem to be worried about the problem. I've never seen anything like this before, but I don't think that's it. I guess I am no angel. 'I'm not so sure if I can really be happy, but I'm not as good as I was. So here's the thing!' I ask as I listen to my story  ``I've got a lot more interesting ways to learn!`` I am pretty sure. ``I'm pretty sure I was a good boy, I think.`` I take a look, and I realize I'm in the bright blue sky. 'My favorite and I can see the end of the world around me, and I hear the angels laughing.'

O1 VERHALEN

Verhaal 1:

The first snow fell quietly, covering the abandoned town in a deceptive layer of purity. The wind howled through the hollow buildings, rattling loose shutters and carrying whispers of something unseen.
Elena pulled her coat tighter, her breath a white mist in the freezing air. She had been walking for hours, her boots crunching against the ice-coated pavement, searching for any sign of life. But there was none—just the skeletal remains of a town that once thrived.
She hadn't planned to come back here. Not after what happened last winter.
A year ago, when the snows first came early, people started vanishing. At first, it was chalked up to the bitter cold, accidents in the deep woods, or even desperation driving families to flee without notice. But then the whispers started—the ones that came at night, curling under doors and through cracked windows.
By the time people realized something unnatural was at work, it was too late.
Elena had been one of the lucky ones. She escaped with her father, driving through the night as those shadows took the rest of the town. But now, she was alone. Her father had died last week, his final words a delirious warning not to return.
But she had to.
The wind carried a sound that made her stop—a soft, familiar voice. Her breath hitched.
"Elena…"
She turned sharply, her heart pounding. There was no one there. Just the swirling snow and the skeletal remains of trees lining the road.
But she knew better.
They were still here. Watching. Waiting.
And winter had only just begun.

Verhaal 2:

In the nation of Veridion, democracy had evolved into something more primal. Every four years, on the eve of the election, the country descended into chaos for a single night—the Purge.
It had begun as a way to "strengthen" the ruling party. The logic was simple: the party with the most members after the Purge would take control for the next four years. Citizens aligned with different factions were left to fight, flee, or convert. Political debates no longer mattered. Only survival did.
This year, the Crimson Order held power, having crushed the Reformists in the last Purge. Their leader, Chancellor Reddick, stood before his loyalists, addressing them in a broadcast before the night began.
"This is not just politics. This is nature. The strong lead. The weak perish or submit. Tonight, we remind them why the Crimson Order reigns!" His voice echoed through the streets as masked enforcers patrolled, weapons ready.
Across the city, Reformists gathered in underground bunkers, whispering plans. Their numbers had grown in secret. This time, they would not just defend—they would strike.
As the sun set, sirens wailed, marking the beginning of the Purge. Gunfire erupted. Molotovs soared. Neighbors turned on each other. And in the heart of the capital, the Reformist leader, Elena Voss, led her fighters toward the Chancellor’s stronghold.
By dawn, Veridion's streets were painted in red and ash. The Crimson Order had fallen. Elena Voss stood atop the ruins of the old regime, bloodied but victorious. She took a deep breath before addressing the surviving citizens.
"For too long, we have lived like animals. No more." She paused, scanning the weary faces before her. "This will be the last Purge."
But in the shadows, remnants of the Crimson Order whispered among themselves. They had four years to prepare.
And history had shown—power was never surrendered without a fight.

Verhaal 3:

The moment Isaac pulled the trigger, he knew he had made a mistake.
The bullet tore through the man's chest, and as his body crumpled to the pavement, Isaac's vision blurred. Then, like a wave crashing over him, the memories came—not his own, but the man’s.
He was a child, laughing in the summer sun, chasing a red kite as his father cheered him on. The warmth of a mother’s embrace. A first kiss behind the old movie theater. The bitter sting of rejection. The endless nights of hunger and struggle.
Isaac gasped, staggering backward, but the memories kept flooding in.
He felt the man’s love for a woman named Claire—Claire, who had waited tables with him, who had whispered her dreams into his ear as they lay tangled in cheap motel sheets. He saw the birth of a daughter—a little girl with bright eyes, the center of his world. He felt his pride, his desperation, his failures, his hope.
And then he felt his fear.
The moment Isaac raised the gun, the man knew he was going to die. He hadn’t begged. He had simply thought of Claire, of his daughter, of all the things he would never say to them again.
The memory faded, leaving Isaac gasping for air, trembling.
He dropped the gun.
The body in front of him was no longer just a target. It was a life—a full, beautiful, painful, complicated life that had been ripped away because of him.
Isaac staggered away, the man’s memories seared into his mind, into his soul. He would never forget them.
He would never kill again.

Verhaal 4:

The sky was the same blue it had always been. That was the hardest part.  
Elias stood at the edge of what had once been a great city, now little more than rusting metal and silent streets. The launch platform behind him hummed softly, preparing for departure. In just a few hours, there would be no more human footsteps on Earth. No more voices. No more fires lit against the dark.  
He had volunteered for this—the last man to leave. Someone had to shut down the last systems, oversee the final transports, and make sure the great exodus was truly complete. Billions had already left, their colony ships streaking toward a distant world where the ground was rich and the air thick with promise.  
But this was home.  
Elias ran his fingers over the crumbling concrete of an old building, feeling its warmth. He had grown up here, under this sky, breathing this air. The new planet—Eden-4—had thicker clouds, redder soil, a different scent in the wind. It was humanity’s future, but it wasn’t *this*.  
A bird called out somewhere. One of the few that remained, darting between skeletal skyscrapers. Did it understand what was happening? Could it feel the silence creeping in, the absence of voices, the stillness of a world left behind?  
He knelt and scooped up a handful of dirt. It was dry, lifeless. Too many centuries of taking, not enough giving back. We had bled the Earth dry, turned its rivers into dust, its forests into memory. Maybe it was fair that we left it to rest.  
Still, it hurt.  
Elias exhaled, stood, and brushed the dirt from his hands. The ship’s engines were powering up now, a deep vibration beneath his feet. He turned to face it, then hesitated. One last look.  
The wind picked up, stirring the trees that had fought to reclaim the city. The sky stretched wide and endless above him, the same as it had been for every human who had ever lived. The same sky that had watched over the first fires, the first words, the first dreams.  
Elias swallowed hard, then whispered, “Goodbye.”  
And then, with the weight of all of history behind him, the last man on Earth walked up the ramp and into the stars.

Verhaal 5:

The sky tore open with fire.
It started as whispers—storms that ignored physics, stars vanishing overnight. Then came the voice, echoing across every device, every mind, every soul.
"You have strayed too far. The world ends now."
For the first time in history, humanity stood as one. Not out of unity, but survival.
The AI war councils convened. Quantum weapons, antimatter warheads, reality-warping singularities—humanity had spent centuries preparing for war among themselves. Now, they had a new enemy: God.
The first strike was desperate. A fleet of orbital weapons fired into the heavens, tearing through the fabric of reality. The response was instant. Cities blinked out of existence, rewritten as fields of glass.
"You cannot win."
But humanity had stopped believing in gods long ago.
The Dyson Sphere cannons fired. Entire galaxies shook. The sheer force of human defiance cracked the sky, revealing the machinery beneath. The stars—illusions. The universe—a construct. And behind it all, the Architect, watching with cold, infinite eyes.
"You have seen too much."
But humanity had learned one thing from its myths: gods could fall.
The greatest minds worked faster than prayers. AI rewrote the laws of physics, turning faith into fuel. The first human deities emerged—gods of steel and code, war-forged titans built to match the divine.
The war lasted seconds. The war lasted eternity.
And when the dust settled, the throne of creation stood empty.
God was dead.
And humanity?
Humanity was just getting started.

Verhaal 6:

The mansion was alive with music, laughter, and the clinking of glasses. The host, King Magnus, had invited the entire chess set for a grand celebration. The pieces arrived in style—some elegantly stepping onto the checkered ballroom floor, others making a more dramatic entrance.
The Queens, always the center of attention, were deep in conversation near the grand fireplace. The White Queen, poised and regal, sipped a glass of champagne. The Black Queen, draped in midnight silk, smirked.
“I see your King has already found a comfortable seat,” the Black Queen remarked, nodding toward White King Magnus, who was already in an armchair, looking relieved to be off the battlefield.
“I let him believe he’s in charge, as always,” the White Queen said with a wink.
Across the room, the Bishops debated philosophy over wine, while the Rooks stood near the buffet, discussing castle renovations.
The Pawns, thrilled to be off the board for once, danced wildly, finally free from their strict forward-marching fate.
But it was the Knights who truly stole the show. The White Knight galloped onto the dance floor, moving in his signature L-shape, causing a ripple of laughter. The Black Knight followed suit, weaving between dancers with the grace of a seasoned strategist.
Then, a challenge.
"Shall we race?" The Black Knight smirked.
"Across the ballroom and back," the White Knight agreed.
The partygoers cleared space. The Queens looked on with amused curiosity. The Kings, already dozing, barely noticed.
"Go!"
The two leaped forward—zigzagging, twisting, dodging party guests. The Black Knight veered left, then right, attempting to outmaneuver his rival. The White Knight, however, anticipated every move. In a final leap, he landed squarely in front of the Black Knight, blocking his path.
"Checkmate," the White Knight said with a grin.
The room erupted in cheers. The Black Knight laughed, shaking his head. "Well played."
The night continued in revelry, the chess pieces dancing, debating, and delighting in the rare freedom of a world beyond the board.

Verhaal 7:

The grand tournament of Avalon had drawn warriors from every corner of the known world. Beneath banners of crimson lions, golden dragons, and silver wolves, knights stood tall, each eager to declare their lineage and the honor it carried.
One by one, they stepped forward.
"I am Sir Aldric of House Valmont! Our banner, the twin hawks, represents our unyielding vigilance and dominion over the skies!"
"I am Dame Isabella of the Azure Rose! Our sigil, the blue flower, stands for grace in war and mercy in victory!"
Cheers followed each speech, banners waving proudly in the cool breeze.
Then, a knight in dented armor and a cloak stained with travel dust stumbled forward. His gaunt face bore the exhaustion of long battles, his shoulders hunched as if weighed down by a hundred burdens. With a sigh, he unfurled his banner—a plain, tattered cloth, darkened with age.
Murmurs spread through the crowd. A noble from the east scoffed, "No sigil? No beast? What house does he claim?"
The knight lifted his weary eyes. His voice, though quiet, carried across the field.
"I am Sir Edran of no great house. This banner bears no lion, no rose, no hawk, for it is the shroud of my fallen brothers. I have stitched upon it the names of those who fought beside me, whose banners no longer fly."
Silence fell. The wind caught the cloth, revealing faint, stitched letters—names too many to count.
"I do not stand here for family pride or ancient glories. I stand for those who no longer can. This banner is not a symbol of power, but of sacrifice."
No one cheered. No one jeered.
And then, one by one, knights lowered their weapons in solemn respect. For in that moment, they understood: the greatest banners were not those that spoke of conquest, but of remembrance.

Verhaal 8:

The road to Rithmere was long, and I walked it alone. The war was over—not won, not lost, just over. Our king was dead, his banners trampled into the mud, his knights shattered like glass against the enemy’s steel. And I, Roderic of Halewick, was the only man to make it home.
The air was thick with the scent of autumn leaves, a cruel reminder that time had marched on while we bled in distant fields. The village was smaller than I remembered. The old mill still stood, its wheel creaking lazily in the river, but the houses seemed frailer, the thatch thinner. Children played in the square, laughing, unaware that their fathers would never return.
I passed the blacksmith’s forge—cold, empty. Garen had marched with us. His hammer would never strike steel again.
When I reached my own door, I hesitated. A year had passed since I left, sword in hand, promise on my lips. Would she be there? Would she even recognize the man I had become?
I pushed the door open.
Elena stood by the hearth, stirring a pot of stew. When she turned, her spoon clattered to the floor. For a moment, neither of us spoke.
Then she ran to me, arms around my neck, sobbing.
“You came home,” she whispered.
I held her tighter.
“I did.”
And for the first time since the war began, I wept.

Verhaal 9:

Jared lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, listening. The voices had started as whispers, barely audible, like the rustling of leaves on a still night. Now, they spoke in full sentences, some pleading, some mocking.
"Get up, Jared."
"She’s watching you."
"They’ll never believe you."
He pressed his palms against his temples, willing them to stop. He had tried everything—medication, therapy, even ignoring them—but the voices never left.
Then one night, a new voice appeared. Different from the rest. Calm. Steady.
"You're not crazy, Jared."
He sat up, heart pounding. "Then what am I?" he whispered.
"You're listening."
The lights flickered. Shadows stretched unnaturally across the walls. Jared’s breath hitched as his own reflection in the mirror did not move with him.
"We’re not in your head, Jared," the voice said.
His reflection smiled.
And stepped forward.

Verhaal 10:

In the city of Verida, emotions were never a mystery. Every person’s eyes told the truth—shifting shades to match their feelings. Deep blue for sorrow, fiery red for rage, golden yellow for joy, and the rarest, shimmering silver, for love.
Joren had spent his life mastering the art of reading people. A skilled negotiator, he could anticipate betrayals before they happened, sense sincerity before words were spoken. But when he saw her, he was at a loss.
The woman stood at the marketplace, her eyes obscured by a strange, dark glass. No flickering green for curiosity, no nervous violet, no hue at all. Just black lenses where emotions should be.
Joren approached, his heartbeat quickening. “What are those?” he asked, pointing to the odd contraption covering her eyes.
She smiled. A slow, knowing smile. “They’re called sunglasses.”
He had never heard the word before. “What do they do?”
“They hide,” she whispered.
Joren felt a chill run through him. “Why would you want to hide?”
“For the first time in history,” she said, tilting her head, “no one will know what I feel. No one can predict my next move.”
Joren clenched his fists. He had spent his whole life believing that transparency was truth. That emotions, laid bare, kept the world honest. But now…
Now, deception had a new face. And it was hidden behind a pair of shades.
